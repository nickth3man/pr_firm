# 4. Non-Functional Requirements

## 4.1 Performance
- **NFR-001**: Complete end-to-end flow in <60 seconds for 3 platforms
- **NFR-002**: Support concurrent processing of multiple platforms
- **NFR-003**: Handle up to 40KB of input text (Reddit maximum)
- **NFR-004**: Process Brand Bible XML up to 10KB

## 4.2 Scalability
- **NFR-005**: Support addition of new platforms without core refactoring
